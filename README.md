# ComputerSimulation
Codes in Python for the 2nd year course: Computer Simulation
The 5 checkpoints are individual tasks, but most of them are tasks that help doing the final project.
Checkpoint 1: Python class representing a polynomial and with which we can perform simple mathematical operations on polynomials.
Checkpoint 2: Application to simulate the radioactive decay of unstable nuclei.
Checkpoint 3: Python program that will give a visual representation of the Mandelbrot set.
Checkpoint 5: Simulation of the path of the moon Phobos orbiting the planet Mars using numerical integration. 
FINAL PROJECT: simulation of the path of the planets of the Solar System orbiting the Sun using a different numerical integration than the one in Checkpoint 5.
