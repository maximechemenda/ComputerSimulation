# ComputerSimulation
Codes for the 2nd year course: Computer Simulation
The 5 checkpoints are individual tasks, but most of them are tasks that help doing the final project.
Checkpoint 1: The aim of this checkpoint is to create a Python class to represent a polynomial and to use this class to perform simple mathematical operations on polynomials.
Checkpoint 2: The aim of this checkpoint is to write an application to simulate the radioactive decay of unstable nuclei.
Checkpoint 3: The aim of this checkpoint is to write a Python program that will give a visual representation of the Mandelbrot set.
Checkpoint 5 :The aim of this checkpoint is to simulate the path of the moon Phobos orbiting the planet Mars using numerical integration.
